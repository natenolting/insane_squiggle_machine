Project Description
---
"Fermium Platinum Pipes" is a project studying isometric shapes, allowing them to weave themselves together. Each section of the pipes is permitted to travel in any cardinal or ordinal direction. In addition, the length and size are determined by random numbers terminating at a margin.

Features
---
1. Aspect ratios:
- Landscape 50% probability
- Portrait 50% probability

2. Color Palettes:
The color pallets are based on the top colors on ColourLovers.com. Each adjacent color in the pallet is tweened five levels to add more varietyâ€”all equally probable. See https://github.com/Jam3/nice-color-palettes for more info.

3. Cells
The sketch has an underlying grid, which determines the elements' tightness, looseness, and placement.

4. Density:
It is used as a constant random value from fxrand() for building several internal elements.
