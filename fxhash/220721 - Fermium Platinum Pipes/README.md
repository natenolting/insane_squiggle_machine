Project Description
---
"Fermium Platinum Pipes" is a project studying isometric shapes, allowing them to weave them selves together.

Features
---
1. Aspect ratios:
- Landscape 50% probability
- Portrait 50% probability

2. Color Palettes:
Color pallets based on the top colors on ColourLovers.com. Each adjacent color in the pallet is tweened 5 levels between to add more variety. All equally probable. See https://github.com/Jam3/nice-color-palettes for more info.

3. Cells
The sketch has an underlying grid, which determins the tightness or loosness and placement of the pipes.

4. Density:
Used as a constant random value from fxrand() for building several internal elements.
